# Decentralized and Open Source Software (DOSS) License, Version 1.0

## Preamble
Freedom is a fundamental right. Likewise, Decentralization is a fundamental responsibility. This initiative is a step beyond the already established idea of Free & Open Source Software, or FOSS. This open source license aims to govern the use, modification, and distribution of software within a decentralized and open source framework, balancing functionality, usability, and security while acknowledging the shared responsibilities of the community.

## Definitions
- **Software**: The program, code, or associated files under this license.
- **Contributor**: Any individual or entity that modifies or contributes to the Software.
- **Decentralized Component**: Any part of the Software designed to operate on a decentralized network.
- **Sensitive Component**: Any part of the Software that handles security-sensitive operations.

## Characteristics
The Decentralized and Open Source Software (DOSS) License, Version 1.0, represents an innovative approach in the realm of open source licensing, combining elements from established licenses while introducing new features to address the specific needs of decentralized software development. The DOSS License embodies the following characteristics:

1. **Unique Emphasis on Decentralization**: A defining feature of the DOSS License is its focus on decentralization. It mandates that decentralized components of the software remain open and operable by any entity, ensuring resilience and distributed governance. This clause is specifically tailored for decentralized and distributed software systems, making a transition from traditional open source licenses.

2. **Permissive Nature Similar to the MIT License**: The DOSS License shares the permissive nature of the MIT License, allowing users to use, modify, and distribute the software freely. This aspect aligns with the MIT License's minimal restrictions on software redistribution.

3. **Patent Rights Clarity from the Apache License 2.0**: Adopting a feature of the Apache License 2.0, the DOSS License includes a clear and explicit grant of patent rights from contributors to users, aiming to reduce patent litigation risks and foster an open collaborative environment.

4. **Copyleft Provisions in the Spirit of the GNU General Public License (GPL)**: The DOSS License incorporates a copyleft approach, akin to that of the GPL. This mandates that any modifications or contributions to the software must be shared under the same DOSS License, ensuring that enhancements remain freely available under the same open source terms.

While the DOSS License shares the permissiveness and non-restrictive patent stance of the MIT and Apache licenses, respectively, its incorporation of GPL-like copyleft and the novel decentralization requirement provisions set it apart. This makes the DOSS License a distinctive option for projects that value open collaboration, patent clarity, and the principles of decentralized software development.

## Terms and Conditions

### Grant of License
Subject to this license, Contributors grant a perpetual, global, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, modify, distribute, and sublicense the Software.

### Source Code
The source code must be made freely available, except for Sensitive Components, which may be selectively obfuscated or hosted separately to enhance security.

### Decentralization
Any Decentralized Component must remain open and operable by any entity, ensuring no single point of failure.

### Community Responsibility
Contributors and users share the responsibility for maintaining the network's integrity, security, and functionality.

### Contributions
Modifications or contributions to the Software must be shared under the same DOSS License, with Contributors responsible for ensuring the security of their contributions.

### Patent Rights
- **Implied Rights**: By contributing to or distributing the Software, each Contributor implies a grant to practice any patents within the contributed or distributed code, limited to the Software and its Decentralized Components.
- **Explicit Grant**: Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Software.
- **Termination**: This patent grant shall terminate for any entity that initiates litigation alleging that the Software or any Decentralized Component thereof constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement.

### Liability
The Software is provided "as is," and Contributors shall not be liable for any damages, including but not limited to, loss of data, revenue, or reputation.

### Termination
Rights under this license terminate immediately if a user or Contributor violates its terms. Upon termination, the offending party must cease using the Software.
